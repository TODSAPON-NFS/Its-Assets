1. Installation
===============

- Upload the SimpleAssets files to a folder on a web server supporting PHP 4.

- For importing, change the file_uploads line in the /etc/php.ini file to file_uploads = On  (This file is in the php directory in Windows).  Restart Apache.
		
- Ensure you have a MySQL server running on your server or network. If MySQL is hosted remotely, modify these settings at the top of the config.php file:
	- $ip = “localhost”;  // use the IP of the machine hosting MySQL
	- $sql_login = “root”;  // enter the MySQL login name to used
	- $sql_pass = “”; // enter the MySQL password to be used

	- If desired, modify the auto generated database name by replacing the $sql_db line to
		- $sql_db = “dbname”; // where dbname is the name of the database to use
		
	- The organization name can be entered by modifying $org_name line.
		
- Open your web browser and go to the URL where SimpleAssets is installed.  Click “Install”.

- To permanently transfer the asset to or from yourself, click the “Transfer” tab.  Follow the wizard, which includes selecting a transfer date, which in most cases will be today’s date.
	- An administrator must approve all transfers, and therefore they will not be immediately displayed. SimpleAssets’ Message Mailbox will notify you when your transfer has been either approved or denied.

- To temporarily sign out the asset, click “Sign Out” and follow the wizard, which includes selecting sign out and sign in dates.   
	- Certain dates may be blocked out since an asset can only be signed out to one person per day.
	- The asset must either be signed in when the asset is returned or the sign out must be cancelled before its start date otherwise it is listed as overdue.

- To remove an asset entirely from your profile, transfer it to either:
	- General Assets (all active shared assets like Servers and Digital Cameras)
	- Surplus (all inactive assets in storage)
	- Retired (all assets which are no longer in our possession)

- If the start date of the transfer or sign out has passed, the cancel button will be unavailable.  For sign outs, you’ll have the option to “sign in” the item instead.  All sign outs must be manually signed in or they become listed as overdue.

- Additional update features allow administrators to activate and deactivate employees as well as change their user access level and reset passwords.

- Additional reports are included for administrators including access to the employee spreadsheet report and a full report of all IPs and to whom they are assigned.   The confirmation report is also enhanced to allow administrators to e-mail requests that employees verify their details.
