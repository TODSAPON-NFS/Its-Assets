Its Assets INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


===========
NEW INSTALL
===========

- Upload the Its Assets files to a folder on a web server supporting PHP 4.

- For importing, change the file_uploads line in the /etc/php.ini file to file_uploads = On  (This file is in the php directory in Windows).  Restart Apache.
		
- Ensure you have a MySQL server running on your server or network. If MySQL is hosted remotely, modify these settings at the top of the config.php file:
	- $ip = “localhost”;  // use the IP of the machine hosting MySQL
	- $sql_login = “root”;  // enter the MySQL login name to used
	- $sql_pass = “”; // enter the MySQL password to be used

	- If desired, modify the auto generated database name by replacing the $sql_db line to
		- $sql_db = “dbname”; // where dbname is the name of the database to use
		
	- The organization name can be entered by modifying $org_name line.
		
- Open your web browser and go to the URL where Its Assets is installed.  Click “Install”.

The MySQL database is autocreated if a MySQL server is found and the software can be used right away.
